- where are filters created? (shoudl have command line for passing in 'filter images' to provide MF. Reason being is that we have Penalty terms ) 

- what is the input line that needs to be run? 

- walk through optimizer code with me so I can find all missing files needed

- need annotated images for WT and CHF as well 

- what are the tests that can be run from command line to generate figures for paper
figures.py WT.png
figures.py MI.png
figures.py CHF.png

- add in unit test (e.g. if assert(content-truth>abs,"somthing changed)"

-Integrate MF stuff into gpu code
-test by running unit tests 

PKH 
-port over/refactor MF code for both silica and myo

-verify that ROC is working
