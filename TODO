## Dylan 
- results are 'nan' for validation.py 
-- stackedHITs messed up? 
- DONE need annotated images for WT and CHF as well 
- add in unit test (e.g. if assert(content-truth>abs,"somthing changed)" 


## Ryan 
-Integrate MF stuff into gpu code
-test by running unit tests 

## PKH 
- DONE port over/refactor MF code for both silica and myo 
- DONE verify that ROC is working 
-generalize ROC curve generation that is currently defined in fig.py (probably port to optimizer) 
-- DONE Extract silica-specific terms in TestParams()
-- DONE Merge roc generation from figs into optimizer
-- generalize how annotated data is passed in (subregion vs channel)

- implement pentalty filter stuff 
- modify filter to notch out clutter in tissue
